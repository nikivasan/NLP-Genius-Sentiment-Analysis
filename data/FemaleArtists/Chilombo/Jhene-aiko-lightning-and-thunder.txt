Been up since six doin' rituals
Burning incense just to wish you well
Throw all my cents into wishing wells
Smelling your scent, I do miss you still

What kind of spell do you have me under?
What in the hell, starting to wonder
I am not well, I'm going under
Can't help myself, lightning and thunder
[Verse 2: John Legend & 
Jhené Aiko
]
Oh, what if the feeling's reciprocal
She misses me like I miss her soul
I don't wanna drown in a sea of regret
But it seems like that's all I have left
What in the hell, what kind of spell did you put over me?
Controllin' me, what in the hell
What kind of spell did you put over me? (
Ooh
)
Controllin' me

I've been a sick individual
Ever since you made it official
You went and did the unthinkable
I am still here and available[Chorus: Jhené Aiko & John Legend, 
John Legend
 & 
Jhené Aiko
]
What kind of spell do you have me under?
Oh, what in the hell, I'm starting to, starting to wonder
I am not well, I'm going under
Can't help myself (
Yeah
), lightning and thunder
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah

It's just like lightning and thunder
It's just like lightning and thunder
It's just like lightning and thunder
It's just like lightning and thunder

What in the hell, what kind of spell did you put over me?
You took control of me
What in the hell, what kind of spell did you put over me?
You took control of me, yeah
