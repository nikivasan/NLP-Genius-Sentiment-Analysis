I'm a 50 hour paycheck
Ain't slept a damn wink
Moth to a neon light
I'm a 9 to 5, 10 to 2
Shower in between the two
Let it ride kinda guy
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime

Punchin' that time clock
Wearin' them wings off
Wishin' I was someone else
Ridin' 'round crazy
Just tryin' to save me
Is puttin' 'em straight through hell
My mama's been praying
Daddy's been saying
"Son, how the hell you get by?"
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime

I got some bar stool best friends
Little off the deep end
That's my kinda crowd
A little rough around the edges
Get a little reckless
Might get a little too loud
But we'll be fine
With our angels workin' overtime
Punchin' that time clock
Wearin' them wings off
Wishin' I was someone else
Ridin' 'round crazy
Just tryin' to save me
Is puttin' 'em straight through hell
Yeah, my mama's been praying
Daddy's been saying
"Son, how the hell you get by?"
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime
Come on

Ooh, Gary sounds good on that steel
Come on, come on, Ben

Punchin' that time clock
Wearin' them wings off
Wishin' I was someone else
Ridin' 'round crazy
Just tryin' to save me
Is puttin' 'em straight through hell
Yeah, my mama's been praying
Daddy's been saying
"Son, how the hell you get by?"
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime
Oh, I got my
Angels workin' overtime
Time to clock in, boys
Come on
Angels workin' overtime
