E-yeah-yeah-yeah (Oh)
Whoa
E-yeah-yeah-yeah

I just seen lil' mama Instagram and she flexin'
Don't care about your puppy, just that ass and them breastses
Oh, girl, you a model? Damn, I never woulda guessed it
And if you tryna throw out all them vibes, I'ma catch 'em
The lifestyle we live is just too dangerous
Paranoid since they've been leakin' my shit
Wonder if it'll come out on the web
And I can't help all these bitches on my dick
Takin' a photo and postin' that shit
Comin' home late and I crawl into bed
She always be askin' me, "Where have you been?"
Whoa

The world has gone to shit and we all know that
People freakin' out, like, hit the Prozac
Leon DeChino shorts got all the blogs mad
Well, fuck the internet, and you can quote that, whoa

Instalove
Well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
And I'll prolly be the last to know (Whoa)
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more
Instalove
Well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
And I'll prolly be the last to know (Whoa)
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
