Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Ooh)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Damn)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Ooh)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

They said I would never get this far, ah, ah
Think that we don't see who you are, are, are?
Laughin' to the bank like ha, ha, ha
Guess that I'm just talkin' too much blah, blah, blah (Shut the fuck up)
So, where did y'all go? (Ooh)
When I was shit broke, couldn't even buy smokes
Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show (Stadium show)
She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh
I know it's hard to swallow your pride
Sorry that you can't get over me (Over me)
Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I

Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Damn)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Ooh)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Damn)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad
Close to my enemies (Let's go)
I need better energy (Huh?)
When I told you fuck you, you thought I was playin', huh?
(Yeah, yeah) But I meant the shit literally
She want to vibe but I told her fuck that (Nope)
She looking at me like she surprised
They're packin' the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
And I (Ooh)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Damn)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Ooh)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Damn)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

It's too late to turn this shit around (It's too late)
Only held me down when you wanted me to drown
It's too late to turn this shit around (It's too late)
So don't try and tell me that you're happy for me now

Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Dead to me)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Tendencies)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad
Ooh, it's too late
It's too late
