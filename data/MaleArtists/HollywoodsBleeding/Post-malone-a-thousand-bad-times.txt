Yeah, oh, whoa, ooh
Yeah, yeah

Said you needed a ride, but you wanted my car
Without that face, girl, you wouldn't get far
I really like you, despite who you are, oh (Who you are)
You see me on TV, you know I'm a star
You say you don't know me, but I know that's false
I'll pay the price, girl, whatever that cost, oh (What it cost)

You make my life so hard
But that's what gets me off

I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? (What's that to me, yeah)
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? (What's that to me, yeah)
'Cause I can take anything that you give me (What you give me)
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch
So thank you for the grave (Yeah)
I needed me a place to sleep (Place to sleep)
And I don't wanna meet your mama (No)
She prolly crazier than you (She prolly crazier than you)
I'm gonna need some thicker armor (Armor)
To spend another night with you (And on and on and on)
Baby, I know just what to do
Every time you fuck me over, I'll come back to you
Baby, I don't want to know the truth (Know the truth)
I ignore them when they tell me all the shit you do (Shit you do)
I always get my heart broke like I needed the practice (Needed)
Foot on my throat 'til my world is collapsin' (Damn)
But this what I chose, it's the law of attraction, yeah (Attraction)
(And on and on and on)

Girl, you make my life so hard (So hard, so hard)
But that's what gets me off

I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? (So what's that to me, yeah)
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? (So what's that to me, yeah)
'Cause I can take anything that you give me (What you give me)
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch (Kill me)
So thank you for the grave (Yeah)
I needed me a place to sleep (Place to sleep)
I should get out, but I still want more
I should get out, what am I waitin' for?
It's all the same to me, it's all a game to me
It's all the same to me, it's all the same

I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? (What's that to me)
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? (What's that to me)
'Cause I can take anything that you give me (What you give me)
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch (Kill me)
So thank you for the grave (Yeah)
I needed me a place to sleep (Place to sleep)
We go there, oh
