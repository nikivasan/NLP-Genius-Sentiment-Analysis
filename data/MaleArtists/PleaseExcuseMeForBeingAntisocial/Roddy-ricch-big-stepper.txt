Yeah

Mmh, ayy
Big stepper like Big Meech, mhm
I was taught to go and get it straight up out the mud, lil' nigga, ayy
Murder, murder, murder, keep my slugs, my nigga, ayy
I was taught to never show no love, my nigga
Pop a Xanax, I ain't never had no feelings
What I got planned next? Gotta put the stars in the ceiling
Slidin' down Fairfax, nigga, I was plottin' on a million
I want a billion, nigga, so that's on God, I ain't chillin'

Yeah, hah, Perky, Perky, dirty soda, ayy
Only talk bags on the Motorola, ayy
Push the Hellcat like an old Corolla, ayy
I'ma let these racks talk for me, nigga
Bitch, and I ride with the shooters, ayy
Made my cousin a killer, uh
And at fifteen, I was neighborhood drug dealer
I'm so cold hearted, I can't show no love, nigga
But I fuck that bitch to PARTYNEXTDOOR, "Persian Rugs," nigga, uh
Bought a brand new AP, it was fifty thousand total
It felt like the Flu Game when I sold out the Novo
I had to finesse and get the bag, I had mad dough though
If he ain't tryna go get the safe, I get it crackin' solo
Mmh, ayy

Bird Vision, Bandcamp
Had a bad bitch put a hundred thousand in her spandex
That hundred that made me a million, I got it laminated
Can't fuck with none of these broke niggas, they contaminated
Thank God for all of these blue faces, I barely done made it
Made forty thousand on New Years, took a private to Vegas
I been on promethazine so long, when I'm slidin', I'm faded
I been tryna get a crib so long, now I got it, it's gated
I been touchin' all these millions, I know they gon' hate it
My chef cook up filet mignon, got sauce and then ate it
Nigga, I been ballin' every season like Kobe with eight
, yeah
All these niggas gon' hate
I stayed down and got rich
Now I'm fuckin' on his lil' bae
