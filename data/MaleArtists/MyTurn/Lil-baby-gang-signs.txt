[Verse 1: Lil Baby & 
Three 6 Mafia
]
First of all, you know I bang 4's (4)
Never met JAY-Z, but in my hood I'm like Hov (Roc)
Everyday a holiday, my lifestyle goals (Goals)
Everything white and rose, I don't really like gold (Nah)
Came through in the Maserati (Skrrt), knew I was gon' get it poppin'
Serve a nigga in every hood, Baby good with everybody (Good)
With no understanding, I ain't planned, let's get it clarified
I just spent a hunnid on a chain and didn't care about it
Try me, they gon' hear about it, make a call to every side
Drop a bag and air 'em out, get the drop on every house
Nah, I'm really playin', I'm just sayin', I don't play at all
I been in the field for so long, but I ain't playin' ball
Choppa chop his hand off, found the plug and ran off
Think I need a agent the way I play it, call up Rich Paul
Never fold and never forget the code, you better stand tall
I done put them bags from Gresham Road to West End Mall
Try and knock your mans off, I know it's too much tension with you bitches (
Throw-throw 'em up
)
Niggas better stick to rappin' 'fore I click and get to trippin'
(
Throw-throw 'em up
)
I got double-digit millions, and I still be with the killers (
Throw 'em up
)
Boy, I gotta be the realest livin', can I get a witness? (Amen) 
(Throw-throw 'em up)
Nobody ain't stressin' on my side (Nah)
4PF the gang and niggas know how we gon' ride
Couple choppas, couple stolen cars, it's time to slide
I hope the cameras don't catch the tag, and if they do, we'll be alright
Yeah
Where you from? How you come? Yeah, yeah
Where you from? (I'm from 4) How you come? (Going dumb)
Throw it up, let me see
Throw it up, let me see
Throw it up, let me see
Throw it up, let me see
Where you from? (I'm from 4) How you come? (Going dumb)
Where you from? (I'm from 4) How you come? (Going dumb)
Throw it up, let me see
Throw it up, let me see
Throw it up, let me see
Throw it up, let me see

I got 'em jockin', watchin', pockets always sloppy
Be with papi, play, he pop your noggin, better play with caution
I'm the same one who used to sell the weed then went to Washington
Who you know that went to prison, came back home and straight pocketed?
We ain't whippin' shit, straight droppin' it
Let 'em keep the extras, we on top of it at this point
I done ran my money long as Lee Street through East Point
Supercharge my motor for the pig, hit it, oink-oink, yeah
Runnin' up the paper like I never woulda thought of (
Throw-throw 'em up
)
Make sure everybody eat 'cause that's the way that I was brought up (
Throw-throw 'em up
)
4's in this bitch (
Throw 'em up
), I'm talkin' really, really rich (
Throw 'em up
)
I got my young niggas rich, they probably fuckin' on your daughter (Baby)
(Throw-throw 'em up)[Chorus: Lil Baby & 
Three 6 Mafia
]
Where you from? (I'm from 4) How you come? (Going dumb) Yeah-yeah
Where you from? (I'm from 4) How you come? (Going dumb)
Throw it up, let me see
Throw it up, let me see
Throw it up, let me see
Throw it up, let me see
Where you from? (I'm from 4) 
(Throw-throw 'em up)
 How you come? (Going dumb)
Where you from? (I'm from 4) How you come? (Going dumb)
Throw it up, let me see (
