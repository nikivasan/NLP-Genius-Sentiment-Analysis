Cook that shit up, Quay

Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Yeah

Clothes busted, nose dusty, watch the older bros hustlin'
Started off wrong, but you couldn't tell me I ain't know nothin'
All I ever want was to put on and give my folks somethin'
Knockin' on my sister window, comin' in at 4 somethin'
Mama trippin' 'bout the way I'm livin' and how my hoes comin' (In and out)
Caught the next-door neighbor slippin', we slimed him, left his nose runnin' (In his house)
Knowin' I can't lie, so when she asked me, I  make no comment
Terrorizin', thuggin', doin' dumb shit, makin' no money
It was time for me to go up, got a pack and made it blow up
Went into that corner store until I got it all
Know I skipped a couple parts, but I can't never tell 'em all
But the moral of the story, I got it all out the mud
The way karma make me feel, I swear I think I'm in love
Been fuckin' strippers since I was lil', fell in love with the club
Bruh gave me everything I need, knew what to say to the plug
I got my hands on a few mil', but shit, it still ain't enough
It's like my life is like a dream, but I'm still here when I wake
I'm gon' get everything I need, I'll do whatever it take
I caught a case, ran, got away, I should've jumped in the lake
I thought about it the other day when I slid through in the Wraith
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain

Bad bitch, we both young
They say that I'm cheatin' and we both dumb
But Baby got her wrist hittin', both arms
G-Wagen and Range Rover, both of 'em
If we love forever, you get new homes
I just wish that other **** could move on
She proud to be rockin' that new two-tone
My life goin' good, why would I do wrong?
I'm livin' my best just like Lil Duval
I didn't get the message, and it's screw y'all
I don't want no issues, can't be beefin' with my family
I don't want no problems, just make sure my kids can count and read
And it ain't no pressure 'bout the money, I won't even see it
It's bigger, it's the principle, I hope one day that you can see
We got a whole seed to raise, it's bigger than you and me
How I'm not gon' do that? I spend millions on my jewelry
The only reason I'm mentionin' it is 'cause I'm tired of this foolery
I'm just emptying my thoughts, I can't keep 'em in a box
Ain't no hard feelings at all, I want everyone to ball
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain

Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
I said I don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
