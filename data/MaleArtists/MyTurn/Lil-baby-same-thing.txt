Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
)

I been the type of guy she like since middle school
Never thought that I'd get famous, always know that I'd be cool
Could've been fucked on shawty, I just didn't wanna be rude
Eliantte diamonds, I want the finest for your jewels
And my hitter 'dem be slidin', don't put cameras on my crew
I ain't doin' too bad, I'm somebody, you can Google me
I ain't never worried 'bout what they say that they gon' to do me
I just put in overtime, I'm doin' numbers like it's two of me
That was back then, times change, this a newer me
Money conversations at the table, I speak fluently
Stay away from bad vibes, I can't see no nigga doing me
Still give a couple thousand, even though she would of did it free
They don't treat me like no rapper 'cause my vibe like I'm in the streets
I'm one of the top five, it ain't too many guys as real as me
I barely get sleep, I'm tryna make sure everybody eats
Took a trip to overseas, I'm buyin' drip in other currencies
I'm on fire right now, and it ain't somethin' that's just currently
And a bitch told a lie if she told you she was curvin' me
And we all big dawgs, ain't gon' let my people work for me
911, we got a problem, it's an emergency, yeah

I heard that crime pays (Uh)
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
No matter what, at least a quarter for my main thing
Showed up on Forbes, I can't complain, I'm tryna maintain
Hop off a plane, pick up a check, then do the same thing
I heard that crime pays
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
No matter what, at least a quarter for my main thing
Showed up on Forbes, I can't complain, I'm tryna maintain
Hop off a plane, pick up a check, then do the same thing
Lately, I been diggin' your vibe
I can tell by the look in your eyes
That you need to get some shit off your mind
I give you my time, give you jets in the sky
Have you runnin' 'round in laps for me
I perform, when I'm done, you should clap for me
You got problems on your head, you can chat with me
Have you runnin' around the globe chasing racks with me
M's in plastic, sometimes I'm sarcastic
I just like to hear laughter, tryna ease all this pain
Took off fast, I know they hate how I passed 'em
Don't gotta be in the grave, they throwin' dirt on your name, yeah

I heard that crime pays, uh
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
No matter what, at least a quarter for my main thing
Showed up on Forbes, I can't complain, I'm tryna maintain
Hop off a plane, pick up a check, then do the same thing
I heard that crime pays
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
