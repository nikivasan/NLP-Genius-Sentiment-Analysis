Cook that shit up, Quay
)

This ain't the vibe that I need
Stop the beat, G5 free
I be spendin' racks in these jeans
I'm too real, fuck is y'all mean?
I ain't have to sell you no dream
I said what it was, you didn't believe me
You be the cake and I be the cream
Now I look up and then she was leaving
I'm on the way, cannot be late
Speedin' through traffic like I'm in a race
I wanted it now, she want me to wait
I'm one of a kind, so you gotta taste it
Granddad died, knew I would make it
I'm a real one, you can't fake that
Most of my niggas still be takin'
I got rich, this shit still don't faze me
You only get one call, I can't chase 'em
Might take one shot, a lil' chaser
Stayin' up now for us to fuck later
Mama used to tell me times would get greater
Cartier diamonds blockin' these haters
Dior drip, shit gettin' tapered
I just spent a Bentley truck with lil' Tatum
Favor for favor, nigga, I don't pay them
Get off my dick, nigga, we don't play them, yeah
Look like it, we don't stay here
Makin' half a million dollar plays, juggs
Still chunkin' up neighborhoods
Grass cut, sure the neighbors good
My partner's mama know I'm really hustlin'
If the spot hot, we invade houses
We got kicked out, go in they house, yeah
It was hot and it was dark and I had thought of ending it all
Then the sun had came out and I looked up and I seen God
Ain't gon' lie like it was easy, it's the truth, this shit been hard
I done finally got an award, yeah

Tired of this car, then switch it (Switch up)
Tired of my ho, new bitch me (Please)
At this point, this shit pimpin' (Pimpin')
Never off, be consistent (Huh)
Glock two-three extension (Bah-bah)
Handle the business, don't mention
I ain't even have a pot to piss in
Now I got 'em mad, I'm turnin' livid

Now I got 'em mad, I'm turnin' livid

My cars come with stars and kits
None of my kids gon' starve for shit
You weren't even here when I started this
All the drugs I sold, all the shit I took
I done seen so much, I can write a book
Ain't stuntin' that ho, I can buy that look
Clothes off, how your body look?
I been 'bout business, I'm still a crook
I get in my mode, they all be shook
Said that's your bro, y'all all get pushed
You was in the house on punishment
I was in the hood sellin' strong ass kush
Your cuz came through with that Reggie Bush
Give me style and credit for all his looks
Sold-out shows in the DMV
Now Shaquille O'Neal can't lil' boy me
Had some dirt off in my diamonds, had to brush it off
I was 'posed to be somewhere workin', I'm somewhere fuckin' off
I get checks in by the contract like I'm playin' ball
I been hanging 'round some millionaires, it's safe to say it's rubbin' off

Tired of this car, then switch it (Switch up)
Tired of my ho, new bitch me (Please)
At this point, this shit pimpin' (Pimpin')
Never off, be consistent (Huh)
