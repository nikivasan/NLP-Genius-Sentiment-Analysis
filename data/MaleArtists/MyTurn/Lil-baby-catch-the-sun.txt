Seems like we runnin' outta time
Yeah, we still so young and got so much to find
We can't never let 'em break our mind
We gotta stay strong, conquer and don't divide
I come in peace, my heart already set on fire
If it ain't color, what's the difference from you and I?
I'll let you decide or come up with some repeated lies
I'm just tired of my kind gotta be the one to die
Lookin' in the sky, I know you with me, I can't cry
Standin' what I stand on, I can't never switch sides
Sometimes I just wanna pop out on 'em and flip by
But I put my head on, I pray, I stay from off the route
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas, I ain't seen 'em in a while
Thinkin' 'bout my son, I just had another child
I been thinkin' back on bro, like, "What the fuck we gon' do now?"
On this road to redemption, this shit get rocky and it's wild
Let me tell you 'bout it

I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest
Know you be behind me if it ever came to this
But I never would've thought that we'll have to take this risk
Or ever be in this position, just keep ridin', don't go missing
If we in this together, this the way it 'posed to feel
I'm going out with a bang, I'm tellin' you what it is
If I get racial profiled where I live
'Cause my crib bigger than theirs, or my cars up to date
Or it's probably be my girl shape, they probably wanna date her
Or they heard I got my cake up, middle finger to them haters
My life finally matters, I got up and I'ma stay up
I know it lookin' like a dream, but it ain't everything it seem
Ain't no tellin' where I be if I ain't have God or ain't have my team
Can't let 'em trick me out the streets, I got a mind of my own
I left the house at sixteen, I told my Mama, "I'm grown"
Been through a lot of situations, I can handle my own
If I had only one call, I know you pick up the phone
If they ain't with us, we gone

I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest
