        "Comparing these sentiment scores together, we can conclude that songs in the most streamed albums from female artists are more positive in nature, but the lyrics in men's albums are a little more negative. The differences between women's lyrics and men's lyrices are subtle, but they are still telling about the relationship between streaming behavior and gender biases. Audiences prefer to listen to more positive songs from female artists but slightly negative songs created by male artists. This finding can also be indicative of the gender norms in music composition, suggesting that female artists tend to write more positive songs and male artists tend to create more negative and neutral music."
